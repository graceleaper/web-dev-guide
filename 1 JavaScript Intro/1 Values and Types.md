# Values and Types

## Values
* Note: console.log() is a JavaScript method used to display data
* The number 5 is an example of a value
* The string `apples are good` is also a value
* Basically, valuesa and types **are  things that JavaScript is able to output**
```
console.log('5 is: ', 5);
console.log('apples is:', 'apples')
```
* Note: A comma in a console.log is used to concatenate (or add) values
## Types

* Every value has a type:
    * The type of 5 is a 'number'
    * The type of 'apples' is a 'string'
* Values of the same type share similar behaviors in JavaScript
* Later, we'll see that values of type 'string' can be turned into all  uppercase or lowercase letters -- but any value with type 'number' cannot be turned into uppercase or lowercase

* `typeof` operator
    * `console.log(typeof 5)` => number
    * `console.log(typeof 2.3)` => number
    * `console.log(typeof -1821)` => number
    * `console.log(typeof 'apples')` => string

* Modulus operator
    * The % operator divides 2 numbers and returns the remainder

* Use strictly-equals operator (===) to see if two values are the same
