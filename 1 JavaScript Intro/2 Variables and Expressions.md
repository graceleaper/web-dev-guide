## Variables and Expressions

### Variables
* Values can be stored in a variable
* Use the assignment operator =
* === strictly equals operator

```
let myNum = 5;
console.log(myNum);
const myNum = 5;
```
* `const` keyword stores assigned value in a constant variable that _cannot_ be reassigned
```
const favoriteBootcamp = 'Fullstack'
```
* A constant variable holds one value, and one value only â€“ so this
variable's value cannot be changed elsewhere in the code

### Expressions
* Anything to the right side of an assignment (equal sign) is called
an expression. It is any valid unit of code that resolves to a value"
